# EmbeddedMusicPlayer
This music player can be embedded in a chatbot based on the mock and PRD. It can be run in xcode by importing the xcode project in this dir.
To demonstrate its functionality, I created a playlist with 3 MP3 files. When you start the simulator, you can play around with this playlist. I've made the favorite selection persist between simulator restarts/app re-launches.
You can also run the test cases, where it will invoke the simulators.

The demo file is "ScreenRecording.mov".
And a screenshot of my demo is in the file "Screenshot Of My Demo.png".
And another demo named "ScreenRecordingAccessibility.mov" is to show the accessibility Voice Over is in place. Thank you.
